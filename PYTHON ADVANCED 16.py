pattern matching, text searach , validation, maniulation, transformation, text replacrmrnt, extraction,efficiency, automation etc.

# Ques 2
Both (ab)c+ and a(bc)+ are valid patterns. the difference between both these patterns is in (ab)c+ ab is group whereas in a(bc)+ bc is a group.

# ques 3
import re statement always has to be imported before using regular expressions.

# Ques 4
 The Characters .,*,?,^,or,(), have a special signiface when used with square brackets. They need not be be explicitly escaped by \ as in case of pattern texts in a raw string.

# Ques 5
it can improved performance, better code readablity and maintainability, it can raise error if there is some syntax error.


# Ques 6
When using the re.match() and re.search() functions in Python's regular expression module (re), they return a match object if a match is found.

examples
accessing the match String
extracting the matched groups
Getting start and end positions of the match
Splitting the string based on the matched pattern


# Ques 7
both have different functionalities in regular expression.
the vertical bar (|) is used for alternation
 square brackets ([]) define a character set


# ques 8
Raw Strings are used in the regular-expression search patterns, so that blackslashes do not gets escaped.
