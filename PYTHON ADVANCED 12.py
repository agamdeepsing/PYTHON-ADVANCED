 String’s indexed character cannot to be assigned a New value , as Strings are immutable.

# Ques 2 
+= operator is used to concatenate strings, it does not violate Python’s string immutability Property.

# Ques 3
A Character in string can be indexed using string name followed by the index number of character in square bracket. Positive Indexing or Negative Indexing.

# Ques 4
We can access elements of sequence datatypes by using slicing and indexing. Indexing is used to obtain a individual element while slicing used for sequence of elements

# Ques 5
Indexed characters and sliced substrings have datatype String.

# Ques 6
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, and each character within a string is treated as a single element.
for eg :
str = "how are you"
character = str[0]

# Ques 7
+, += and * allow to combine one or more smaller strings to create a larger string. <string>.join(<sep>) method joins element of iterable type i.e list and tuple to get a combined string.

# Ques 8
Checking the target string with in or not Operators before using the index method to find a substring just helps confirming availability of substring and thus avoid raising of ValueError.
