
# Ques 1
it gives us the output of how many different outcomes are in an experiment.

values generated from a random process are inherently unpredictable.Based on
the previous data and the occurences of the random event, we can predict the
outcome in terms of probabilities.

# Ques 2
Truly random numbers are not predictable.
All pseudo-random numbers are predictable(if can be determined).

Latter is considered good enough as they have sort of uniform distribution.

# Ques 3
two main factors are mean and the variance.

# Ques 4
 A Real-life example of a normal distribution are heights or blood
pressure measurements

# Ques 5
In the short term, a probability distribution can exhibit various 
behaviors.
we can expect a behaviour of probability distribution:
1.central tendency
2.skewness
3.spread
4.dispersion

As the number of trials or sample size grows, the observed frequencies
tend to converge to theoretical probabilitiesand the distribution of sample
means tends to approach a normal distribution.

# Ques 6
list, string, and tuples can be shuffled by using random.shuffle.

# Ques 7
Conversions to Integer
Arithmetic function
Exponential function
Logarithimic function
Periodic functions
Quadratic function
Hyperbolic function
Trigonometric function

# Ques 8
both exponentation and logarithm are inverse of each other.
The standard form of exponential is ax = N

logarithmic function form as logaN = x 


# Ques 9
log2(x) 
log10(x)
log1p(a)
